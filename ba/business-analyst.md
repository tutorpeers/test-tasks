# Business Analyst task

The goal of this task is to write a User Story in a rule-oriented format. A reasonable set of pre-conditions or expectations is up to you, where relevant.
Please, cover both positive and negative scenarios, focus on ensuring its exhaustiveness and absence of ambiguities, and avoid redundant repetition of similar requirements.
Additionally, stick to functional requirements and try to refrain from making UI or UX decisions. 

It is also okay to submit your additional ideas not covered by the story to prevent "scope creep".

1. Prepare a User Story describing flight check-in functionality on the airline's website.
2. Prepare a User Story describing a newspaper subscription process online. Consider that a newspaper can be delivered online only, as a printed copy to a limited set of countries, or both.
3. Prepare a User Story describing an app to manage the settings of an automated cat feeder. Please, focus on the feeding process itself. Assume the user has already created an account.
4. Prepare a User Story describing the functionality of the Google Hangouts online meeting tool.
5. Prepare a User Story describing vet availability management to allow pet owners to schedule appointments online.
6. Prepare a User Story describing a freelancer marketplace sign-up process. Consider the ability to sign up with email and password or with a LinkedIn account.

Good luck!
