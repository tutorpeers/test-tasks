# Solutions Architect task

The goal of this task is to prepare a text document for engineers describing how to approach the implementation of a particular functionality. The description should describe the solution while avoiding ambiguities in the approach. Consider a system with at least three components: Infrastructure, Backend (background jobs, API), and Frontend.

A reasonable set of pre-conditions or expectations is up to you, where relevant. 
Just submit them and any extra ideas not covered by the document.

1. The team needs to implement an LMS where multiple groups of students may work on the projects together and respond with free text essays to question blocks (this of Google Forms or Typeform).
   As these essays get pretty big, they must be auto-saved every 10 seconds so that users do not lose their input. Users must be able to collaborate on these items, but real-time collaboration is optional.

   The team of two engineers (Backend and Frontend) is working on the collaboration feature, and it needs to be rolled out within 6 weeks. 
   What is the most suitable solution, and what limitations would you impose? Please, draft implementation guidelines.

2. The team of two engineers (Backend and Frontend) must implement a real-time messaging system. The system should support conversations between two users and allow automated system notification messages.
   The initial scope also includes replies, the ability to delete messages, and conversation archival (to account for users who delete themself).

   To deliver faster and save on the development budget, the business prefers to choose a third-party solution that covers the requirements.
   Please, choose a third party and prepare a draft implementation guidelines.
   
Good luck!
